### **1. Project Overview**
Find a CFG with ∑ = {a,b} and will create the language L and contains strings which will have twice as many a's as there is b's. The grammar msut be proven correct and also must be justifiable why it is the simplest that could be made for this language L. 
### **2. Context-Free Grammar**
Context-Free Grammar (CFG) allows us to show languages using using variables together with production rules to convert those variables into alphabet symbols. When a string only has alphabet symbols and no variables that is when we can call it a context-free grammar. 

A CFG is defined by a 4-tuple notation:
G = (V, ∑, R, S)

V is a finite non-empty set which contains the variables
∑ is the set of alphabet or symbols
R is a set of rules where in the form X --> y where X must belong to V and y must be a string in V or ∑
S is a variable in the set V known as the start variable
